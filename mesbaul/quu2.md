In the provided code, there are both user-defined functions and library functions. Here's a breakdown:

**User-Defined Functions:**
1. `int isPrime(int x)`: This function checks whether a given number is prime or not. It's a user-defined function because it's defined by the programmer within the code.

2. `int isEven(int y)`: This function checks whether a given number is even or odd. It's another user-defined function created within the code.

**Library Functions:**
1. `printf()`: This function is part of the C Standard Library and is used to display output to the console. It's a library function provided by the C programming language.

2. `return, int, if, for`: These are not functions but keywords or language constructs in C used for control flow and returning values. They are part of the C programming language itself and not considered functions.

In summary, `isPrime()` and `isEven()` are user-defined functions, while `printf()` and the language constructs (`return`, `int`, `if`, `for`) are part of the C Standard Library or language itself.

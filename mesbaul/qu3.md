To calculate the values of variables `x` and `s` at each cycle in the given code snippet, let's break it down and track their values within the loop:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x, s;
    x = 1;
    s = 0;
    while (x < 5) {
        s += x * x;
        x++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

At the beginning:
- `x` is initialized to `1`.
- `s` is initialized to `0`.

Now, let's go through each iteration of the `while` loop:

1. **Iteration 1:**
   - `x = 1`
   - `s += x * x` (which means `s = s + (1 * 1)`) → `s = 0 + 1` → `s = 1`
   - `x++` → `x = 2`

2. **Iteration 2:**
   - `x = 2`
   - `s += x * x` (which means `s = s + (2 * 2)`) → `s = 1 + 4` → `s = 5`
   - `x++` → `x = 3`

3. **Iteration 3:**
   - `x = 3`
   - `s += x * x` (which means `s = s + (3 * 3)`) → `s = 5 + 9` → `s = 14`
   - `x++` → `x = 4`

4. **Iteration 4:**
   - `x = 4`
   - Since `x` is now `4`, the condition `x < 5` is no longer true, so the loop exits.

Therefore, after the loop:
- `x = 4` (the value that caused the loop to stop)
- `s = 14` (the accumulated sum of squares during the loop)

These are the final values of variables `x` and `s` after the execution of the given code.

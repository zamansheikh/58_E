```c

    int x = 4, y = 0, a = 3, b = 1, c; // Initial values: x = 4, y = 0, a = 3, b = 1 Because my Daffodils id : 4031

        if (3 < 5 || c > 9) // Line 10: This condition is true (since 3 is indeed less than 5)
        {
            c *= c; // Line 11: c = 1 * 1 (as c = 1 from Line 6) => c = 1
        }
    }
    else
    {
        if (c == 3) // Line 15: This condition doesn't apply as c = 1, not 3
        {
            --c; // Line 16: Not executed as the condition above is false

Summary of variable values:
- At Line 2: `c = 4`
- At Line 6: `c = 1`
- At Line 11: `c = 1`

For variables `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`, there are no operations or changes made to their initial values (x = 4, y = 0, a = 3, b = 1) throughout the code. Therefore, their values remain the same as initialized.
